# Software Challenge

A set of Ubuntu, Gazebo and ROS 2 examples and projects to help new Subbots Software team members.

This repository will act as a starting point for new developers in order to help them understand some of the fundamentals of ROS 2 and Gazebo, and to guide the installation of the Ubuntu OS.

# Ubuntu 20.04 installation guide

ROS 2 and our robot's on-board computer (Nvidia TX2) use on a linux distribution to operate, for our development work we will be using Ubuntu 20.04 preferably dual booted alongside windows (Mac users may need to explore virtual box options).

For this tutorial, you'll need a blank, >8 GB stoarge USB stick. 

For dual-booting: 
  Windows instructions: https://www.tecmint.com/install-ubuntu-alongside-with-windows-dual-boot/
    Note: BIOS can also be accessed by restarting using Recovery options menu in windows. 
  Mac Instructions: https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-dual-boot-ubuntu-mac/
  
Once Ubuntu is installed, you will need to install a preferred IDE. Some suggestions are listed below: 
  Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/ide/
  Clion: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/ (can be tedious to setup, requires an account) 
  VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/ (strenuous setup but very powerful IDE)
